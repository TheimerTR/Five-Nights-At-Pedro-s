Five Nights at Pedro's is a horror puzzle game based on the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise by Scott Cawthon.
The game takes place in a closed room with several key points that must be monitored or interacted with to stop the animatronics from attacking you and survive the night.

Features:

Level selector: screen to select the difficulty of the game [Tutorial, Easy, Normal, Hard]
Tutorial: teaches the player the basics of the game
Win: survive until the 6am
Flashlight: use it to see in the dark and fight against Foxy
TV remote: it can be used to interact with the menus and change channels for Chica

The mechanics:
Freddy: Freddy will hide his puppets around the room, find them and return them to the cupboard before it is too late. He can't kill you.
Foxy: When he appears on the windows, flash him with the flashlight until he disappears.
Chica: She is watching cartoons on the TV. When the channel changes to Ads, take the controller and change the channel again.
Puppet: He is close to the windows on his box, he will always be rising from it. Don't let him escape it, and pull it down with your hands.
Bonnie: He is in the corridor behind the door. He will knock it before opening it so be sure to be hidden behind the door when that happens.

The game has no narrative as such as it's an arcade game.

Game made by Quokka Game Studio.
